                        dominated the San Diego news racket from the late 60’s to the early 70’s. Although he was
                        most notable for his amazing abilities to deliver the news, he was also a man of deep passion,
                        loved a good glass of Scotch and was
                        not shy about showing off his exceptional “guns”.</p>
                    <p> Yes, it’s true, Ron Burgundy lived a life that most men can only dream of. He had the touch
                        with the ladies, and broke many hearts along the way. But as the story goes, along came a woman
                        who would forever change his life. Veronica Corningstone and
                        Ron fell in love and eventually co-anchored for CNN. They spent many years side by side reporting
                        the worlds news before retiring and traveling abroad. To this day, there has never been another man
                        quite like Ron Burgundy.</p>
